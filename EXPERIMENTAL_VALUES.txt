PIP2 + AP2 <=> 
    ka2: 0.7e-3 uM^-1 s^-1

This paper uses effective concentration of PIP5K at the surface
to make its calculations, as described in https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.21027. Maybe not the
most reliable, but ok for this.
Km1 = 15 uM (from HA-PIP5Kγ on SA-PtdIns4P, not sure if SO-PtdIns4P which is 1.6 is actually in body)

Synaptojanin 1 in people (kcat7, Km7) (Only used enzymes)
DOI: 10.7554/eLife.64922
diC8-PI(4,5)P2 is what is of interest I think, with Mg2+ and no mutants
kcat7=85.3 s^-1
Km7=39 uM

Modified AP2 subunit binding to PIP5K (ka3, kb3)

ka3 = 0.118 uM^-1 s^-1
kb3 = 0.0609 s^-1
