# Julia code for optimizing and analyzing oscillatory solutions for a model of a membrane-localization driven biochemical oscillator

All polished code is in the OscillationPaper directory. Each Julia file within that is divided by what figure/analysis is for. 

Commonly used types/functions are in UTILITIES.jl. Just type ```include("$PATHSTRING)``` to use them in your code.
