#TODO Currently, we have it so that LpAK_0=K_0=sum(both). Need to find more realistic initial concentrations.
#TODO Also, we have to find what regimes the MM will hold on the 2D in addition to just the regular set-up.

"""
Michaelis-Menten approximation of the original oscillator model, without all possible pairs of reactions
Note that V_max=kcat*E. Because the velocity of the reaction is given by V_max[S]/(Km+S),
we can rewrite this as kcat*E0*S/(Km+S), and in the code for the rate equations,
we then divide this by EÃŸ*S and use mass conservation to find E0 since our equation is interpreted as
 a typical rate equation.
